This is a Twitter Sentiment Analysis project using ‘R’ developed by Felipe Solares da Silva to perform a sentiment analysis using the sentimentr package to identify the sentiment from tweets related to a specific Netflix content (series, movies and documentaries, for example).

## Important Sources
In order to perform a sentiment analysis using twitter data, first we need to develop a twitter app.

How to create the Twitter app?

Twitter has made the task of analyzing tweets posted by users easier by developing an API which people can use to extract tweets and underlying metadata.

This API helps us extract twitter data in a very structured format which can then be cleaned and processed further for analysis.

To create a Twitter app, you first need to have a Twitter account. Once you have created a Twitter account, visit https://developer.twitter.com/ and apply for a dev account.

Write the basic details such as application name, description along with a website name. You may enter any test website name as well. Once you have entered these details, you will get keys and access tokens. You will get 4 keys and tokens:

Consumer Key (API Key)
Consumer Secret (API Secret)
Access Token
Access Token Secret

These keys and tokens will be used to extract data from Twitter in R.
